# Insurgence Online Server

This is the server software that handles Insurgences Trading, Battling, Friend Safaris, Wonder Trade, GTS and Friend system.

The software is written in C#, but will work properly on Linux with [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) installed. As the server is heavily dependent on MySQL, 
it is recommended to run it with this installed

Below here is a somewhat simplified flowchart of the process a client goes through when it connects to the server
